Java is a well-known and highly used programming language.  Across many spaces, with many variety of uses.

I have been using Java since I started my sophmore year of highschool.  I have been using it since then consistantly for [robotics]({% link _posts/2022-04-09-FRC.markdown %}), and used it in my AP Comp Sci course over my junior year.  [Robotics Github Repo for my year's contribution.](https://github.com/FRC-8114/2022-2023_shared)

For the AP Computer Science A test, it is considered a college credit, and demonstrates proficiency in Java.  It is scored on a range from 1-5, and I scored a 5.
