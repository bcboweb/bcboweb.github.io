This page is dedicated to my launchpad project dedicated to [FRC]({% link _posts/2022-04-09-FRC.markdown %})

The purpose of a launchpad is to give the co-driver during competitions more ability to control functions on the robot.

This program uses a Novation Launchpad Mini Mk3 and does not have compatability for other versions at the time.

The repo with the program is below, it is in a very basic state at the current moment that is made for just the 8114 team, but I will add instructions on how to implement your own team and add commands as needed.  I have a working version of the JAVA implementation that will also be put in the repo.
