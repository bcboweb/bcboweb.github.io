I am a dedicated student, who actively looks for opportunities to code.  This website is one of those many examples.  I get to knock out my portfolio while also learning web development at a level I haven't gone to yet.

Portfolio for my accomplishments, sorted by dates started in the posts on my [Home](/index.markdown) page.
